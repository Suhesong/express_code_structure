# the scripts directory - for scripts

I like to put scripts in `bin`. 

but the Release Team needs us to put scripts in `scripts`.

I usually write my scripts as bash scripts but feel free to write javascript if you prefer or you want to avoid bash as a development dependency or be friendlier to your Windows-running peers.
